## SQL

```sql
CREATE TABLE [table_name] AS
	SELECT "a" AS name, 1 AS value union
	SELECT "b" , 2 union
	SELECT "c" , 3 union
	SELECT "d" , 4 union
	SELECT "e" , 5;

SELECT [column], [column] FROM [table], [table] WHERE [expression] ORDER BY [expression] LIMIT [limit]

[column]写成[expression] AS [name]可以指定新的column名
SELECT [expression] AS [name], [expression] AS [name] FROM [table] WHERE [expression] ORDER BY [expression]
SELECT name AS nnn, value*114514 AS ysxb FROM temp;

[table]写成[table] AS [aliase]可以指定别名
[table].[column]可以指定哪个的哪个

分组、组内筛选
SELECT [column], [column] FROM [table], [table] GROUP BY [expression] HAVING [expression]
```
